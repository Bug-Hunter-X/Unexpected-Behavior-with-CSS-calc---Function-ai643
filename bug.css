The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results due to unit mismatch or incorrect operator precedence. For instance, using `width: calc(100% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the containing element doesn't have a defined width.  Another common issue is forgetting spaces around operators in `calc()` expressions. For example, `width:calc(100%-10px)` will cause a parsing error.
